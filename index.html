            Spaced Repetition
          </h3>

          <p> 
          How often do you look up a new word you read in a book, or hear it on your favorite drama, only to forget it hours later? 
          </p>
          <p>
          With Shirabe's optimized spaced repetition reminders, you'll see the word again in a few hours, tomorrow, or in a week's time.
